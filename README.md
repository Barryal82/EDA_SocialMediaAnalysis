Social Media Engagement Analysis by Category Using Simulated Twitter Data

# Social Media Engagement Analysis by Category

Welcome to my exploratory data analysis (EDA) project, where I simulated and analyzed tweet engagement data across several social media content categories. This project was created as part of a data analytics learning journey, with the goal of uncovering patterns in social media post performance and drawing actionable insights for marketing strategies.

---

## Project Overview

In this project, I acted as a **social media analyst** working for a digital marketing agency. The task was to:
- Generate a dataset of simulated tweets
- Analyze and visualize the data
- Identify patterns and insights
- Make recommendations to improve social media engagement

---

## Objectives

- Understand engagement trends across content categories (e.g., Fitness, Travel, Food, etc.)
- Visualize distributions of likes per post
- Identify which categories perform best (or worst)
- Practice core Python skills for data generation, cleaning, and visualization

---

## Tools & Technologies

- Python
- Jupyter Notebook
- Libraries: `pandas`, `numpy`, `seaborn`, `matplotlib`, `random`

---

## Dataset Description

This project uses a **synthetic dataset** with:
- **500 posts**
- 8 content categories: `Travel`, `Fashion`, `Fitness`, `Music`, `Culture`, `Family`, `Health`, and `Food`
- Fields:
  - `Date`: The post date (generated using `pd.date_range`)
  - `Category`: Randomly selected category for each post
  - `Likes`: Random number of likes (0 to 10,000)

---

## Key Findings

- **Fashion** posts received the **highest average likes** (5,148), followed by **Travel** and **Culture**.
- **Family** and **Fitness** had the **lowest average likes**, suggesting less engagement.
- The average number of likes overall was **4,843**, with some posts reaching as high as **9,971 likes**.
- A histogram and boxplot clearly visualized these patterns and revealed the wide variability in engagement.

---

## Visualizations

- Histogram of likes across all posts  
- Boxplot of likes by content category  
- Bar chart of average likes per category *(optional addition)*

All charts include custom styling for clarity and aesthetics.

## Reflections & Next Steps

This project helped me practice:
- Generating and cleaning data
- Creating meaningful visualizations
- Summarizing insights for non-technical audiences

### Future Improvements:
- Integrate real tweet data using `snscrape`
- Perform sentiment analysis to see how tone affects engagement
- Build an interactive dashboard using Plotly or Dash

## How to View

If you want to explore the notebook and visualizations:
1. Open `EDA_SocialMediaAnalysis.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook or Google Colab
2. Run all cells to regenerate the dataset and visuals
3. Or view the static version directly in GitHub
